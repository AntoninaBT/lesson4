# Teplova// 4 variables. I need to output the name of the course, total tasks, hours and an average time. I used "" when I printed the text data, I didn't use "" when I wrote figures (the variables that consist figures) and variables in the "print"
tasks = 12
hours = 1.5
name = "Python"
time = hours / tasks
print("course:",name,", total tasks:",tasks,", total hours:", hours, ", average time:", time)
